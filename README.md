# wmsDemo
---

This is a simple demo illustrating how to use WMS with the Esri JavaScript API. Normally I program web services using something like OpenLayers or Leaflet. However, I came across a project where I was required to use the Esri API and found it difficult to make the two flavors "work" together. The problem was that it was difficult to find good examples that would show exactly how a WMS from Geoserver would work with the Esri SceneView. So if I was having some problems, then I am sure others are as well. This first demo is pretty simple, drape a WMS of the Census Bureau's Tigerline Shape file for all the counties in the US over one of the Esri Basemaps. The final product looks like:
